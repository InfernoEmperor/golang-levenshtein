golang-levenshtein
==================

An implementation of the Levenshtein algorithm in Go. Provides edit distances,
edit scripts and ratios for strings (slices of runes).

The documentation can be viewed online here: https://godoc.org/github.com/texttheater/golang-levenshtein/levenshtein

For a package that is similar but more generic and provides more control,
check out Daniël de Kok’s
[editdistance](https://github.com/danieldk/editdistance).
